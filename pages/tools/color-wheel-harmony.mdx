# Color Wheel: Harmony

import ColorWheelHarmony from 'components/ColorWheelHarmony'

<ColorWheelHarmony />

Hi there! If you've been paying attention to my blog, I've previously shared an interactive color wheel with the solids fabric colors [here](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/color-wheel-fabric-and-color-distribution/). And, I've shared some basics of color theory [here](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/basic-color-theory/).

Today, I am sharing new interactive functionality to find hue-match, analogous, complementary, triadic colors from a solids set of your choosing. For example, if you are looking for complementary colors in the Kona solids set, click Kona in the Solids Sets, click Complementary in the Harmony Option, and then click a color on the color wheel to see a list of complementary colors listed below the Harmony options. Or, triadic color schemes will show you color schemes evenly distributed around thirds of the color wheel. Analogous color schemes will show you colors close in hue to your selection, and Hue Match will show you colors closest in hue to your selection.

Please leave any questions or comments below. This was a little hard to figure out how to display, so I'm happy to clarify and maybe even make a video in the future!
