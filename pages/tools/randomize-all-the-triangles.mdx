Update your color pie and click 'Re-generate' to create a random design. Best supported on a desktop/laptop (the save functionality is not supported by up to date iPhones). Read more details about this blog post below!

### The Color Pie

---

A handful of people have asked me for patterns for a couple quilt designs ([this one](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/mini-quilt-november-2017/) and [this one](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/wall-quilt-january-2018/)) that I created via random code. Oh, and don't forget an original cross stitch design [here](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/original-cross-stitch-december-2017/)! Today I'm sharing my randomizing tool used to generate the designs for these quilts.

### A Very Brief History

I originally worked on this little project when I participated in the [Libs Elliott](https://www.libselliott.com/) swap. I started down the path of working through the tutorial that Libs' recommends on her site, only to realize that I already have coding expertise (HTML, CSS, JS, D3.js, SVG) to work on a similar approach without needing to learn new technologies! So, I did it, mostly when then baby Ingrid would be slow to fall asleep in the evenings on my laptop. And then I made the quilts and cross stitch.

### How to Make a Quilt

If you would like to make a quilt from an image you create, I suggest dropping it into a program that allows you to overlay a 12x12 grid. Or print it out and draw a 12x12 grid on top of it. Once you have a grid overlayed, you will see that each of the 144 squares in the grid is made up of three types of squares (a solid color, a half-square triangle, or a half-square triangle combo). Then, you would piece each square at your desired size (accounting for seam allowances), and then piece them together to make your quilt top! If I have time in the future, I'll show more examples on this process.

### A Very Brief Conclusion

This code algorithm is a little different than Libs' quilt designs, but is definitely in the spirit of her work in mixing technology and tactile creations. My tool features [Kona Colors](http://www.robertkaufman.com/fabrics/kona_cotton/), but I'm open to publishing future posts using a different set of solids (or maybe even \*gasp\* patterned fabric!). I've experimented with sizes and different shapes, so stay tuned for alternative algorithms in the future!

Although I'm not asking for attribution on any creations using this code, I wouldn't mind a shout-out in the form of a link or an Instagram tag!
