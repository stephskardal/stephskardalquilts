# Solids Library Now on Github

Hi there! Today, I'm sharing a set of solid swatches written in JavaScript that I've [released as open source on github](https://github.com/stephskardal/fabric-swatches). Github is a website where software people share open source code (and collaborate). You are welcome to use this data under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), which basically means "as is" and on commercial web apps.

The colors in the data set came from several sets of swatches available online, so the color representations are only as good as the photo sets they were based on. I'm hoping to put together a few little tools here and there using these open source solid swatches since most of my quilting uses solids, and I wanted to share this data with anyone who might want to use it, for example my friends over at [PreQuilt](https://prequilt.com/), who are doing fun things with quilting and technology!

I realized that color sorting is a complicated and highly debated topic, so you can sort the solid sets by the options below (hue, saturation, value, luma, and chroma). Click on the options to see how the sorting changes! Weird, huh?!
