# Coloring Sheets for Procreate

Hi there! QuiltCon is now only a few weeks away, and I'm excited to re-share that I'll be teaching Procreate at QuiltCon. As part of my class material, I reached out to quilters via social media in search of quilt pattern coloring sheets to feature in the class content. Here are all the patterns & details I'll be featuring in the companion coloring workbook for class (pattern name, details, pattern link, and website link)! Thanks to all the quilters who contributed!!!
