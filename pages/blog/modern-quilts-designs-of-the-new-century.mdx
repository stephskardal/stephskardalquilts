I'm extremely honored to have my quilt included because I'm so happy to share my work and it's nice to get positive feedback like this so early into my quilting experience. I finished the quilt in May of 2016, and had completed a handful of quilts before then (although I was sewing a lot of apparel).

A few months before I made this quilt, I had joined a local open sew class taught by [Kathleen Baden](https://kbquilts.com/) with the goal of improving my quilting for the year, and this was the first quilt where I was very motivated to complete a challenging original design. And with the help of my teacher and encouragement from my friends in the class, I finally felt that my technical sewing skills were catching up to my ambitious designs! This quilt was shown in [QuiltCon](https://www.quiltcon.com/) 2017 in Savannah, GA, and lucky enough to be included in the book. I look forward to showing more quilts in the future in print and shows!
