Hi! I'm back to share my latest Aurifil Artisan challenge for February, "3+ Thread Weights in One Project".

Back in November, I signed up for a Lone Star class with [Tara Faughnan](https://www.tarafaughnan.com/), and I knew at that time I would be combining my mini lone star with this Aurifil challenge using multiple thread weights, simply because I wanted to have a mini to experiment with multiple thread weights. Prior to this class, I had never sewn a lone star! In Tara's class, we worked on a mini sized lone star, and I downsized event further, working with a solids from my stash. I pieced the lone star using Aurifil 50 weight thread, which is my normal piecing go-to thread weight!

Once I finished piecing, I picked up my Aurifil thread weights:

- 50wt in 2220 (Salmon Orange) and 1231 (Spring Green)
- 12wt in 2120 (Canary) and 1310 (Medium Blue Gray)
- 28wt in 2535 (Magenta) and 2835 (Medium Mint)

I used Warm and Natural cotton batting in this mini and quilted random straight lines along the various lines of lone star, mixing those straight lines and lines at 45 degrees.

    />
    I finished the lone star with binding and thread buries! Below, it is hanging out with some of the mini quilt tops that my daughters made, and some of my other recent finishes. I'm very pleased with the experimentation of both a mini lone star and mixing various thread weights in this project. The mini rainbow lone star was a success enough to convince me to try out a larger version, which I quilted with a mixture of thread weights and colors as well!
