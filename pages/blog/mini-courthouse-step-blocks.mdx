# Mini & Mug Rug Courthouse Step Blocks

Have you seen my [Skinny Courthouse Steps Blocks tutorial](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/skinny-courthouse-steps-block-tutorial/)? Finished strips at 1/2" have become a bit of my signature, and I wanted to sew up a couple of mini quilts using my tutorial to provide a few more visual examples of color palettes and inspiration for quilting. I also kept around the scraps from my chopped up courthouse steps to piece together additional mug rugs.

### Mini #1: White and Bright

My first mini was made with my signature white background with some pops of color (Confetti Cottons lime, peacock, and lipstick). I paired this mini with lipstick Kisses for the quilt back, and used Aurifil 50 weight thread for piecing and straight-line / walking foot quilting. I finished the mini quilt with an art quilt facing to minimize distraction from the design.

### Mini #2: White on Dark

For my second mini, I used 1/2 yard of violet, and paired it with just a bit of fuchsia to finish off the on point blocks, and the remaining fuchsia for the back. I used white for the accent stripes. I went with a similar finishing technique: walking foot quilting with Aurifil 50 weight and an art quilt facing.

### Mug Rugs

The nice thing about chopping off my courthouse steps was that the leftovers could be nicely finished into two mug rugs per mini quilt. I added a bit of leftover scraps in white and fuchsia to join these chopped off pieces and did very simple walking foot quilting. Doesn't your mug need a rug?!

These were a fairly quick sew and you can see more #wip photos below. If you are thinking about sewing up a mini but want to experiment with digital coloring first, [check out this design on QuiltFill](http://www.quiltfill.com/rileyblake-skinny-courthouse-mini/).
