# Solids Sets Wordcloud

Today is a just-for-fun Friday share! Here's a rainbow colorful wordcloud from the names of solids that I shared in [my earlier blog post](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/solids-library-now-on-github/) of solids sets from 8 distributors (Pure Elements AGF Studio, Free Spirits Solids, Riley Blake Designs Confetti Cottons, Robert Kaufman Kona Cotton, Moda Bella Solids, American Made Solids, Michael Miller Cotton Couture, and RJR Studio Cotton Supremes). "Blue" was the winner, with "pink" and "green" coming in 2nd and 3rd. Isn't it fun to see all the color names?! Enjoy!
