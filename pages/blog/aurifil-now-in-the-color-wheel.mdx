# Aurifil Now in the Color Wheel

Hello, blog readers! It's been a while. My life has been a little crazy since my last blog post in late February on [QuiltCon 2019](https://www.stephskardalquilts.com/quiltcon-2019-trip-report/). Around that time, we were in the early phases of a potential move to Ohio. We were starting to figure out a timeline for moving to be in Ohio for the summer, including all the challenges associated with buying and selling a house, and moving with little kids (Yippee?!!!). And here we are about four months later on the flip side, working on getting settled in our new home in Ohio. This means back to blogging, too!

Anyways, I'm happy to share that the 270 Aurifil colors are now included in [my color wheel tool](https://www.stephskardalquilts.com/tools/color-wheel-harmony/). As [a newly appointed Aurifil Artisan](https://auribuzz.wordpress.com/2019/05/03/introducing-our-2019-aurifil-artisan-team/), I have the opportunity to participate in fun Aurifil challenges throughout the year. I am motivated to experiment with new colors and thread weights in the Aurifil product line, and what better way to start than adding the Aurifil colors to my color wheel to experiment with color combinations (both within Aurifil thread only, and relative to fabric colors).

[Aurifil](https://www.aurifil.com/) sells a variety of thread weights, some in all of the 270 colors, and others in a limited color offering. You can find the Aurifil product guide [here](https://www.aurifil.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AURIFIL-MAY2018.pdf) to review all the thread weights and see recommendations on how to use them.

## Some Fun combinations

Below are a few fun color combinations I've come up with to start using the color wheel tool. Not shown here, you can pair Aurifil colors with a number of solids fabric offerings, too!

### Match: Colors very close in hue

### Complementary: Colors on opposing sides on the color wheel

### Triadic: Three colors (or more, close in hue), spread evenly throughout the color wheel

### Analogous: Colors close in hue (but not considered a match)

### Public Service Announcement on Color Representation

Remember, these colors are only as accurate as the hex colors used, and color display can vary across monitors. The colors in the tool have been collected a few different ways, and color representation can change as the lighting changes. I recommend using the tool as a starting point for inspiration, and then if possible, checking a physical swatch of the substrate (or thread) before purchase. Happy making!
