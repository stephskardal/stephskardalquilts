Don't let my photo fool you - those are Photoshopped quilt show photos into a photo from QuiltCon 2020 (quilt credits tagged [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLksEjUntGb/))!

It’s taken me a few weeks of QuiltCon recovery to get back into the groove of life, even though there was no travel for this year’s special circumstances of a virtual QuiltCon Together. And while we didn’t travel for QuiltCon Together this year, I was still busy during the event with teaching responsibilities and filling time “running into” people on zoom and interviewing them for episodes of Scant Quarter Hour.

### Scant Quarter Hour

Speaking of Scant Quarter Hour (a weekly Instagram video series I film with [@southbaybella](https://www.instagram.com/southbaybella/)), you can check out the full QuiltCon recap episode [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLvbfAbnv5D/). And here are all our daily run-ins, which were filmed during QuiltCon:

Isabelle and I really enjoyed chatting and interviewing everyone during QuiltCon!

### On Teaching

As a teacher, QuiltCon prep has been going on since last mid-2020, when the decision was made to go virtual. This year, I taught three workshops - one on Procreate, one on foundation paper pieced curves, and one traditional and foundation paper pieced strip piecing workshop. I began recording for all my classes in late August of 2020 and filmed until early October, taking 1-2 hours per day working through recording and step-out sewing.

After that, I took a break from recording workshops and then began putting together my lectures throughout December and January. My lectures were both creativity-centric, based on [this blog post](https://www.stephskardalquilts.com/step-one-step-two/). I originally applied for just one lecture based on this blog post, but once we went virtual, it was split into two lectures and I adapted the material into two separate lectures. Once the lectures were prepared, I prerecorded them on Zoom a couple of weeks before QuiltCon Together.

Teaching was a lot of work this year, but overall I was happy with the platform and happy that my students had a positive experience! I have gotten a couple questions on whether I will release class content after the QuiltCon Together license expires (at the end of March). I plan to, but I'm still sorting out the details how that will look.

### On The Quilt Show

While a lot of the feedback I heard was of attendees missing out on the in-person viewing of quilts, I thought the virtual quilt show was successful and I enjoyed the audio component for each quilt (up to 2 minutes of artist audio per quilt). I had 5 quilts in the show, including makes from late 2019 and throughout 2020. Those quilts are now viewable in my [2019](https://www.stephskardalquilts.com/gallery-2019/) and [2020](https://www.stephskardalquilts.com/gallery-2020/) galleries.

Since I’ve tracked a breakdown of quilt categories in the past, I wanted to include this year’s breakdown compared to two previous years:

<GridDisplay
  child1={<PieChart year="2021" />}
  child2={<PieChart year="2020" />}
  child3={<PieChart year="2019" />}
/>

I don’t believe there is much actionable data in this year’s QuiltCon show breakdown, except to note consistencies across the years in specific categories. I might point out that minimalism had relatively less quilts this year, because it may not translate as well to a virtual format but I’m only speculating here. I've had a goal for a while to create a minimalism quilt, but then I just want to add all the piecing or all the colors :).

Anyways, I encourage quilters to make what you want and show-shop later if you feel so inclined to participate in quilt shows.

### What’s Next?!

I think that's all the new content I have here that I haven't shared on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stephskardal/) or as part of Scant Quarter Hour. I believe lots of quilters are looking forward to QuiltCon in Phoenix, 2022. A number of my friends have even booked their hotels already! I can’t wait to escape and have some sense of normalcy. Stay healthy, everyone!
