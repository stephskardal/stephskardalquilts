# Rainbow Blender: August 2018

Hooray! I finished this quilt in August of 2018.

### Design

I created the original design in Photoshop with no color palette. Then, I imported the design into my own quilt coloring tool as a private design, to test out colors. I added a basic rainbow palette to it at the time, but after that, I began to look for the right set of fabrics to use with it. The image you see to the left is what I created in QuiltFill, but once I saw [Alison Glass'](https://alisonglass.com/) Kaleidoscope line, I thought it would be a great fit for the rainbow ombre and the fabric on it's own is beautiful.

Once I got my hands on a fat quarter stack of the Kaleidoscope collection, I selected 32 colors from the set of 40. The 8 excluded swatches are great â€“ the set included a nice plush white, several blue/gray chambrays, and a few pinks/reds (the collection has a lot of pinks/reds!). Like [my June quilt](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/quilt-june-2019/), I had a rough idea on how I would blend colors, knowing that I wanted to blend them more than in my design, but I didn't have it all figured out at that time.

### Piecing

I strip pieced first, sewing a strip of solid color to Kona white, and then cut perpendicularly to that seam in 1" strips. All the strips are cut at 1" and finish at 1/2". You can check out the Instagram photos below to see the process. Once I had 1" strips, I blended the colors between color transitions, selecting 32 colored strips for each row.

### Quilting

I made my quilt sandwich with Warm & Natural batting and a light aqua free spirit voile on the back. I based with safety pins on my kitchen table, like usual! I machine quilted on my Juki with a walking foot using Aurifil 50wt white thread. My straight line quilting adds to the pop of colored strips throughout. I did \*not\* block this quilt, because it laid quite flat after all the quilting, hooray! Normally, I have to block :)

### Binding

Finally, I finished adding Kona white binding. I use my machine to attach the binding first, then I hand stitch the binding on the back using silk thread and Clover #10 applique needles. It's always one of my favorite parts of the project to finish with hand binding (even though I'm very excited to see the finished product)!

### Happy Sewing

While some parts of this quilt were a little tedious and repetitive :), I am so happy with how it turned out. It's so bright, colorful, but speaks to my geometric/linear aesthetic. I hope you enjoyed watching the progress, as that's a big part of what I enjoy, too!
