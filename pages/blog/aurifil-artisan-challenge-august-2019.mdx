I recently participated in the [Aurifil](https://www.aurifil.com/) Artisan challenge for August 2019, where we were challenged to make a mini quilt using [PBS Painters Palette solids](https://pbsfabrics.com/collections/color-solids) combined with Aurifil thread. We selected our preferred thread weight (mine was 12wt), but didn't have a choice in the fabric color.

I was excited when I received [Thistle](https://pbsfabrics.com/collections/painters-palette-solids-2019-colors-of-the-year/products/2019-coty-121-085-thistle) from the [PBS trending colors of the year](https://pbsfabrics.com/pages/paintbrush-studios-2019-colors-of-the-year) and [Aurifil 12wt](https://www.aurifil.com/products/aurifil-cotton-12wt) in 3840 (French Lilac), since these colors were not what I might normally choose (I usually live in the blue/aqua/green space :)). Before I received the fabrics, I knew I wanted to mix domestic machine (not longarm) quilting with hand quilting, to create a blend of precision and handwork. Once I received the half-yard of fabric, I cut two squares measuring just over 16" (for the front and back), and marked the quilt top with my preferred marking tool at 2" increments.

Next, I basted the mini quilt using Warm & Natural cotton batting, and loaded up my walking foot on my domestic Juki. I traced the lines and added horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines in a predetermined pattern. Once I finished the machine quilting, I decided to hand quilt inside all of the diagonal sections. I hand quilted in each of the diagonal sections just a bit inside the machine quilting lines. Finally, I finished the mini quilt with a touch of handwork for the skinny binding.

The mini quilt now hangs happily next to several other quilt finishes in my house. I'm glad I tried this concept of mixing domestic machine quilting with hand quilting, and I hope to experiment on a larger piece in the future.
