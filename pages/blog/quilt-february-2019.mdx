# Quilt: February 2019

<BlogImage src="HB9A4451-1024x682.jpg" width={1024} height={682} />

This quilt has been an epic project for me, so it has taken a bit of recovery time to think about how I wanted to summarize it. And I still need to get more photos when the sun is shining! But here is a blog post about it in the meantime.

### Evolution of a Design

You know the saying about how you can read history backwards? I think that applies here as I look at how I came to this quilt design. Here's a bit of background leading up to the design:

### Implementation (More Photos Below from IG)

Once I had my design in a size that I thought was something I could handle, I brought the design (in SVG format) into Photoshop to break down into small components. Having worked on [the previous quilt](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/quilt-october-2018/), I had a sense of how much piecing I could accomplish in 1 - 2 hour spurts of sewing time each day, which is a good chunk of time where I can remain focused.

I divided my quilt design into these chunks and tackled them one by one. I started with the center X because that would be the most time consuming piecing and after that, I would be happy to move on to quicker piecing (IE for morale). Then, I worked on each remaining side (sort of like a triangle). I merged the sections via non-pieced fabric (not going the "braided" route), via regular machine stitching and a tiny bit of hand stitching, knowing that I planned to heavily quilt these sections.

Once I pieced everything together, I loaded it up on my longarm! I did not want quilting to distract from the piecing, so I chose to outline the pieced strips, like [this previous one](http://www.stephskardalquilts.com/quilt-october-2018/). I wanted denser quilting in the non-pieced section that was consistent with the design aesthetic of the quilt and also not distracting from the piecing. I had a whole two months of piecing to think about the quilting, so I ended up going with straight horizontal lines throughout. Binding in a matching light blue color was added to finish the quilt.

### Materials

- Solid: Robert Kaufman Kona in sky
- Prints: Liberty Tana Lawn, ~50 different prints
- Back: Free Spirit voile
- Piecing thread: Aurifil 50wt, white/offwhite
- Quilting thread: Aurifil 40wt, white
- Batting: Warm & Natural Cotton
- Piecing and quilting via Juki machines

### Conclusion

It's funny that I spent 2+ months on this quilt and the finish was anticlimactic. [But check out the #stephskardalquiltsfeb2019 images on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/stephskardalquiltsfeb2019/) to see all the process photos for this quilt.
