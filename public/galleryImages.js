Original design quilt finished in July 2017, designed in Photoshop
Original design quilt, designed in Photoshop
This original design quilt was designed via code written in JavaScript and constructed of half square triangles and 2.5″x2.5″ squares. It uses a mix of Kona Cotton solids, aurifil thread, and was machine quilted on a Juki machine.

2018:
This original design quilt was designed with a combination of JavaScript and PhotoShop. I love the quilt designs of Libs Elliott, and I wrote code in spirit of her designs but I took it a step further with further editing in Photoshop for color and layout alterations. It uses a mix of Kona Cotton solids and essex linen, Aurifil 50 wt thread, was machinne pieced, and was densely machine quilted on a Juki machine with a walking foot.
I recently finished this original design mini rainbow hexie and sent it off to friends in Portland as a “Thank You” to them. One of these friends told me she enjoyed 6 primary colors together, so I started with a few primary color designs for mini and asked for her input. From there, I picked out a handful of coordinating solids to make this mini quilt and was off!
I recently finished a quilt for the MQG Riley Blake fabric spring 2018 challenge. The quilt uses 4 fat eights selected for the challenge, plus fabrics I picked out to compliment those fabrics (white, aqua, and more stripes). I created the original design for this quilt from a design in Photoshop using Photoshop techniques like basic shapes, clipping masks and smart objects. I quilted my original design with Aurifil 50 weight thread using a walking foot.
I started this quilt back in mid-February, and it’s seen me through two bad sicknesses (flu, strep), two trips with baby Ingrid (QuiltCon and a technical conference), three(!) family birthdays and a few other ups and downs over the three months of other making. In that time, I also finished one wall quilt, this mini quilt, and 3 other mini quilts. Needless to say, I am happy to have finally finished it in mid-May!
Hi there! I finished this mini quilt, which I’m calling “Sending Love” in June of 2018. I didn’t want to say much on social media or my blog because it’s not my story to tell, but the mini quilt was gifted to an open sew friend and her family with the hope that it will bring nothing but joy and happiness to them.
I recently finished what I’m calling my Super Donut quilt. A lot of the inspiration for this quilt is described in my post on my Donut Quilt, finished several weeks prior to this one. And the piecing was fairly similar to that quilt as well – I cut a two paper templates from a 8.5″x11″ printed page clipped from the entire Photoshop design.
I completed this quilt in October 2018, as part of the Michael Miller Hash Dot Challenge for QuiltCon (to be determined if it it will be in the show as of November 2018). For this challenge, we were provided four fat eighths, including three hash dot prints and a solid peach. The rules stated that at least 2 of the hash dots needed to be used, and any number of additional Michael Miller solids could be included on the quilt top.
I’m finally getting around to sharing this quilt on my gallery! This design was created via code (generative art), and it was inspired by my previous improv quilt. When I was making that improv quilt, I wondered if I could emulate my decision making via code, and here is the result of that experiment. The “product” of the generative art was an SVG that I brought into Photoshop and divided into sections to complete that would minimize breaking long colored strips.
I recently finished this mini quilt to submit to the Curated Quilts mini quilt challenge, which provided a specific set of colors and the theme of “triangle”. Lately, I’ve enjoyed participating in challenges, swaps, and calls for submissions because it adds a specific design constraint for me to work within and apply my own style to.
